## Libft
As long as _[Norminette codestyle](https://github.com/gerus66/norme)_ doesn't allow a lot, there is my library of useful functions and structures. \
It was started from an easy task _[(full version in pdf)](https://github.com/gerus66/libft/blob/master/readme/libft.en.pdf)_, and was largely extended since.
### Run & Use
run: `make` \
use: `-I path/to/libft/includes -path/to/libft/libft.a`

### Library:
* std - essencially consists of recreated functions from _stdlib.h_ Ð¸ _string.h_ - easy operations with symbols, strings, memory, pointers
* `list` - _linked list_ structure (with according functions)
* `vector` - _dynamic array_ structure (with according functions)
* `tree` - _dict_ structure based on AVL-tree (with according functions)
* gnl - aka _readlines_ function _[(full version in pdf)](https://github.com/gerus66/libft/blob/master/readme/get_next_line.en.pdf)_ 
* ft_printf - recreated _printf_, including all flags and undefined behavior _[(full version in pdf)](https://github.com/gerus66/libft/blob/master/readme/ft_printf.en.pdf)_

### Codestyle
Developed in strict accordance with _[Norminette codestyle](https://github.com/gerus66/norme)_
